## 🔬 Research Vision

Many people still hesitate to seek healthcare due to barriers such as social stigma, financial constraints, and limited access, particularly in rural areas. My long-term goal is to address these challenges by developing machine learning–driven digital health systems that improve accessibility and equity in healthcare. 

I am particularly interested in how AI can be applied to **mental health**, especially in detecting mental health states from real-world data and providing personalized interventions. For example, I hope to explore how AI-based models can support individuals experiencing depression by enabling early detection and tailored, timely interventions.

### Research Interests
- 🧠 Multimodal sensing (physiological · behavioral · contextual)
- 👤 Personalization under data scarcity
- ⚖️ Fairness & bias mitigation in real-world AI systems
- 🤖 AI-driven intervention systems (LLM · RL · generative models)

## 💼 Research & Industry Experience

### 🎨 Image Generation with GANs
**Affiliation:** Generative AI Lab, Chung-Ang University

[📄 **Publication** · *First-author*, **ICAIIC 2023** (Oral presentation, IEEE)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10066964)

Developed a novel GAN architecture that incorporates distribution-level feedback to improve image quality and mitigate mode collapse.

### 🎵 Personalized Music Recommendation System
**Affiliation:** SK Telecom

Designed a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based music recommendation model that effectively handles cold-start scenarios.

### 🍽️ Image-Based Restaurant Search Systems
**Affiliation:** SK Telecom

Built an image-to-image restaurant search system that retrieves visually similar dishes by comparing CLIP-generated embeddings using cosine similarity.
